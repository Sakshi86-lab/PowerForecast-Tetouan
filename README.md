Electric Power Consumption Forecasting in Tetouan, Morocco
This project focuses on forecasting electric power consumption in different zones of Tetouan, Morocco, using historical data along with weather-related features. The primary goal is to create an accurate prediction tool that can help optimize energy management and support sustainable energy practices.

# Project Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of power consumption records for three zones in Tetouan, with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and diffuse solar radiation. The model is built using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to predict future power consumption based on the given weather data.

# Steps Taken
Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and transformed, including handling missing values and feature engineering (extracting time-based features like year, month, day, hour, and day of the week).
Feature Scaling: Features were scaled to improve model performance.
Model Training: XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, was used to train the model.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
# Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 707.83
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 971,803.80
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 967.56
R-squared (R²): 0.9757
# Key Features
Temperature
